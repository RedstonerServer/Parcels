# Parcels Todo list

Commands
-
Basically all admin commands.
* ~~setowner~~
* ~~dispose~~
* ~~reset~~
* ~~swap~~
* New admin commands that I can't think of right now.

Also
* ~~setbiome~~
* random

~~Modify home command:~~
* ~~Make `:` not be required if prior component cannot be parsed to an int~~
* ~~Listen for command events that use plotme-style argument, and transform the command~~

~~Add permissions to commands (replace or fix `IContextFilter` from command lib
to allow inheriting permissions properly).~~

Parcel Options
-

Parcel options apply to any player with `DEFAULT` added status.
They affect what their permissions might be within the parcel.

Apart from `/p option inputs`, `/p option inventory`, the following might be considered. 

~~Move existing options to "interact" namespace (`/p o interact`)
Add classes for different things you can interact with~~

~~Then,~~
~~* Split `/p option interact inputs` into a list of interactible block types.~~ 
~~The list could include container blocks, merging the existing inventory option.~~
* Players cannot launch projectiles in locations where they can't build.~~ 
This could become optional.

* Option to control spreading and/or forming of blocks such as grass and ice within the parcel.~~

Block Management
- 
~~Update the parcel corner with owner info when a player flies into the parcel (after migrations).
Parcels has a player head in that corner in addition to the sign that PlotMe uses.~~

~~Commands that modify parcel blocks must be kept track of to prevent multiple
from running simultaneously in the same parcel. `hasBlockVisitors` field must be updated.
In general, spamming the commands must be caught at all cost to avoid lots of lag.~~

~~Swap - schematic is in place, but proper placement order must be enforced to make sure that attachable 
blocks are placed properly. Alternatively, if a block change method can be found that doesn't
cause block updates, that would be preferred subject to having good performance.~~

~~Change `RegionTraversal` to allow traversing different parts of a region in a different order.
This could apply to clearing of plots, for example. It would be better if the bottom 64 (floor height) 
layers are done upwards, and the rest downwards.~~

Events
-
Prevent block spreading subject to conditions.

Scan through blocks that were added since original Parcels implementation,
that might introduce things that need to be checked or listened for.

~~WorldEdit Listener.~~

Limit number of beacons in a parcel and/or avoid potion effects being applied outside the parcel.

Database
-
Find and patch ways to add new useless entries (for regular players at least)

~~Prevent invalid player names from being saved to the database. 
Here, invalid player names mean names that contain invalid characters.~~

Use an atomic GET OR INSERT query so that parallel execution doesn't cause problems
(as is currently the case when migrating).

Implement a container that doesn't require loading all parcel data on startup (Complex).

~~Update player profiles in the database on join to account for name changes.~~

~~Store player status on parcel (allowed, default banned) as a number to allow for future additions to this set of possibilities~~


After testing on Redstoner
-

~~Clear (and swap) entities on /p clear etc~~
~~Fix command lag~~  
Chorus fruit can grow outside plots -- not detectable?  
~~Vines can grow outside plots~~  
~~Ghasts, bats, phantoms and magma cubes can be spawned with eggs~~  
ParcelTarget doesn't report a world that wasn't found correctly -- ??  
~~Jumping on turtle eggs is considered as interacting with pressure plates~~  
Setbiome internal error when progress reporting is attached  
~~Unclaim doesn't clear the plot. It probably should.~~ removed    
Players can shoot boats and minecarts. -- ??   
~~You can use disabled items by rightclicking air.~~  
Tab complete isn't working correctly. -- disabled much of it now 
~~Bed use in nether and end might not have to be blocked.~~
